Lab 4: Smileys at the Races

Team members: Jenny Tang and Stephen Em

Description of the Program: The program has smiley racers that are derived from the Animated Smileys from
Lab 2 and 3. These smileys are modified so it shows the smiley's profile as they're racing and
the profile is flipped when a wall is it. Each smiley has its own speed chosen when constructed and each
also has its own strategy when constructed. A strategy will either be that it continuously slows down,
speeds up, or stays the same speed during the race. At the end, statistics will show for the average ticks,
the fastest smiley (the one who took the least amount of ticks), and the slowest smiley (The one who took
the most amount of ticks).

Contributions: Both of us pair programmed on the whole project and took turns, switching every 20 minutes.
